Project Title: Software Company

--Firstly we both discussed about the project title and reviewed softwarecompany.json file.
--Then we decided how to convert this data into xml.
--Then I converted whole file into xml and made the DTD.
--Then Heli my team member checked the DTD and made some changes in that.
--Then I created the XSD file and I had reviewed it
-- Then  Heli created the XSL file and then I had reviewed it.
--Then again we both sat together and made html file of our project
-- and then we did the css of the same file also.
    We both equally contributed and completed the project.
